## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version >= 18.x recommended)
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
* [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Diyow/PACE.git](https://github.com/Diyow/PACE.git)
    cd pace
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project by copying the example file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env.local
    ```
    Then, update the `.env.local` file with your specific credentials and configurations:

    ```env
    # MongoDB Connection URI
    MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

    # NextAuth Configuration
    NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Or your deployment URL
    NEXTAUTH_SECRET= # Generate a strong secret: openssl rand -base64 32

    # Cloudinary Credentials (for image uploads)
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
    NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret

    # Email Configuration (e.g., for Nodemailer using an SMTP service)
    EMAIL_HOST=your_smtp_host
    EMAIL_PORT=your_smtp_port # e.g., 587 for TLS, 465 for SSL
    EMAIL_USER=your_smtp_username
    EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
    EMAIL_FROM=noreply@example.com # Default sender email address

    NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/api
    
    ```
    * **`NEXTAUTH_SECRET`**: This is crucial for securing your sessions. You can generate a suitable secret using the command: `openssl rand -base64 32`.
    * **Cloudinary**: Obtain your credentials from your [Cloudinary Dashboard](https://cloudinary.com/console).
    * **Email**: Configure with your chosen email provider's SMTP details.

4.  **Seed Initial Admin/User Data (Manual Process):**

    **Why Manual?**
    The application UI currently allows admins to register organizers, but it does not have a direct sign-up page for creating the initial admin and attendee account.
    **Password Hashing Process:**
    You will first manually insert user data with a plain text password into MongoDB. Then, you'll run the `hash-passwords.js` script, which will connect to the database, find these unhashed passwords, hash them, and update the user documents directly.

    **Steps:**

    1.  **Connect to your MongoDB instance** using a tool like MongoDB Compass or the `mongo` shell.
    2.  **Navigate to the `PACE_Database` database, and then select the `users` collection.** (This is where the user documents are stored).
    3.  **Manually insert a new document for the admin/attendee user.** You'll need to define fields like `name`, `email`, `role` (e.g., "admin"/"attendee"), and `password`. For the `password` field, enter the desired plain text password.

        *Example User Document Structure (ensure it matches your Mongoose User model):*
        ```json
        {
          "name": "Admin User" / "Attendee User",
          "email": "admin@example.com",
          "password": "YourChosenPlainTextPassword", // The script will hash this
          "role": "admin" / "attendee"
          // Add any other required fields from your User model
        }
        ```
    4.  **Run the Hashing Script:** From your terminal, in the project's root directory, execute the `hash-passwords.js` script.
        ```bash
        node hash-passwords.js
        ```

        This script will connect to MongoDB, find users with unhashed passwords, hash their passwords, and save the changes back to the database.
    5.  **Verification (Optional):** After the script runs, you can check the user's document in MongoDB. The `password` field should now contain a hashed value, confirming the script worked as expected.

5.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    ```
    Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

* `npm run dev`: Starts the development server.
* `npm run build`: Builds the application for production.
* `npm run start`: Starts a production server (after building).
* `npm run lint`: Lints the codebase using ESLint.
* `npm run format`: Formats the code using Prettier (if configured).
